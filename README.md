# NeuralNetworks
Use the code for predicting the binary targets with 90% accuracy (provided sufficient amount of data)

Guidlines to use :
1. The input data must be in real numbers.
2. The output or predictions should be in YES or NO, i.e. 0 or 1
3. Targets should also be binary same as above.

Setting up:
 1. install Anaconda (Python3)
 2. Open Anaconda Prompt Application as Admnistrator
 3. Create environment (by using following commands):
    conda create --name py3-TF python=3
 4. Activate the env (by using following commands):
    conda activate py3-TF
 5. Now type following commands to install the required packages:
    pip install matplotlib
    pip install tensorflow==2.0.0-alpha0
    pip install ipykernel
    pip install nb_conda_kernels
    pip install sklearn
    
 6. Restart Conda and open Jupyter Notebook which you downloaded from this repository and select kernel as py3-TF
 7. Follow the comments in code for more help :)
